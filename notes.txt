Blog post describing use of git to assist in live coding: http://www.jayway.com/2015/03/30/using-git-commits-to-drive-a-live-coding-session/



Outstanding problems:

* Where to put description of couchdb replication?
* Where to put conflict resolution?

* Should probably create slide depicting the data model used
  by our ToDo apps

* Where is pouchDB data stored?  - default adapter uses:
  - IndexedDB (https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/)
  - WebSQL
  data limits?

* Note bleeding edge:
  - Didn't get to fully explore state of IndexedDB/webSQL
